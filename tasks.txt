1. checkout all datasets
2. complete the code of person detection based on PCL ground plane people detection app
3. NITE library -> run on the kinect (online)
4. NITE library -> possibilty of running for offline data (we can create video of the pcd files oci, and pass it to the app)
5. GPU people detection based on PCL
6. data transformation for off file
7. data transformation for occupancy grid

TODO:
- run preprocessing (using ground plane people detection) on MHAD dataset
